                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  
                        Although unique potentials of terahertz wave for chemical identification, material
                        characterization, biological sensing, and medical imaging have been recognized for quite a while,
                        the relatively poor performance, higher costs, and bulky nature of current terahertz systems
                        continue to impede their deployment in field settings. In this talk, I will describe some of our recent
                        results on developing fundamentally new terahertz electronic/optoelectronic components and
                        imaging/spectrometry architectures to mitigate performance limitations of existing terahertz
                        systems. In specific, I will introduce new designs of high-performance photoconductive terahertz
                        sources that utilize plasmonic antennas to offer terahertz radiation at record-high power levels of
                        several milliwatts â€“ demonstrating more than three orders of magnitude increase compared to the
                        state of the art. I will describe that the unique capabilities of these plasmonic antennas can be
                        further extended to develop terahertz detectors and heterodyne spectrometers with single-photon
                        detection sensitivities over a broad terahertz bandwidth at room temperatures, which has not been
                        possible through existing technologies. To achieve this significant performance improvement,
                        plasmonic antennas and device architectures are optimized for operation at telecommunication
                        wavelengths, where very high power, narrow linewidth, wavelength tunable, compact and costeffective optical sources are commercially available. Therefore, our results pave the way to
                        compact and low-cost terahertz sources, detectors, and spectrometers that could offer numerous
                        opportunities for e.g., medical imaging and diagnostics, atmospheric sensing, pharmaceutical
                        quality control, and security screening systems. </p>  
                        <p>Mona Jarrahi received her B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from
                            Sharif University of Technology in 2000 and her M.S. and Ph.D.
