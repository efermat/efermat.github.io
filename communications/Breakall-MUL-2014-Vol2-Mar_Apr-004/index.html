                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To celebrate the 150th anniversary of Nikola Tesla in 2006, Prof. Breakall and Mr.
David Blood presented a very memorable and popular public seminar and
demonstration for the EE Department at Penn State. At this event, the life and
times of Nikola Tesla were discussed and several Tesla coils were displayed and
utilized for various live demos with audience participation. This seminar was
videotaped and Prof. Breakall will play this DVD and slide presentation at this
Spring, 2014, EE Graduate Colloquium.</p>
Nikola Tesla is clearly one of the greatest scientists and inventors in the history of
the technological development of humankind. His patents and theoretical work
created conditions for the electrification of the world by his system of poly-phase
alternating current, the system that is still presently used all over the world. His
work in the field of high-frequency currents and wireless transmission of
electromagnetic waves made the development of radio and telecommunications
possible. Tesla’s research also helped towards the invention of radar, and in many
ways brought about the development of lighting. Tesla always arrived at an
invention in a rather unusual way. He first would work out the whole idea of the
way a device should work to the smallest detail in his mind, and then he would
“see” how it works, and then he would proceed to prove it theoretically, sketch it,
and finally make the device itself that would then work without any problem.
Working things out in his mind and not on paper would insure that his inventions
would be protected. Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, a small village near
Gospić, Croatia.</p>
At the end of the 19th century in Colorado Springs, CO, Tesla performed various
experiments with very high voltages and high-frequency currents. In the laboratory
he managed to produce artificial lightning with the voltage discharge of many
millions of volts and the length of the lightning of up to 40 meters. Nikola Tesla
filed a total of some 300 patents all over the world. He received honorary
doctorates for his work at numerous universities including Columbia University,
Yale University, University de Poitiers, Polytechnic Institutes of Graz, Vienna and
Bucharest, Universities of Belgrade, Brno, Grenoble, Paris, Prague, Sofia, and
Zagreb. Nikola Tesla never married, he left no direct heirs, and he also suffered
from many phobias. He was fascinated by cleanliness and the number three. At
the end of his life he liked to keep company with pigeons.</p>
Besides his native language, Tesla fluently spoke English, French, German,
Italian, Czech and Hungarian. He died in 1943 in a hotel in New York. To honor the
great inventor, the unit for magnetic induction in the SI system was named Tesla in
1960. In 1975, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
established the Nikola Tesla Award that is given to deserving individuals in the
field of electro-energetics. As commendation for Tesla’s achievements, a crater on
the Moon carries his name.</p>
